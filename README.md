# Description of the project

A simulation of a snake traversing a forest and stone-like environment, avoiding obstacles and the water.
It has snake-like movements, and it wanders until it spots a mouse and will lunge at the mouse and eat it.
You are able to change the parameters of the snake with specific sliders.
There is altitude noise if the camera goes too high, and the closer you get to the snake you can hear it.

# Instructions for use

Run on Godot 4.2.2.stable.mono (The .NET version). Press F5 to run root scene

## In-Game Controls

- All controls will also be viewable in the UI

Base controls for the camera :
> [W A S D]

> [Shift] For speed and Camera FOV change

> [Control] For Camera to decrease elevation

> [Esc] To leave the simulation

> [Space] If Flying : Elevation if flying. If Not Flying: Jump on ground and double press for flight

> [V] Visability of the UI

> [F] Fullscreen toggle

# How it works

## Snake

### UI
The UI allows the player to tweak four values in game: max speed, slither radius, slither amplitude and seek radius. The max speed slider changes the overall speed of the snake. The slither radius changes how wide the slithering is performed. The slither amplitude determines how the amplitude of the slithering. Lastly, the seek radius determines how far the snake's seek behaviour will get a random position in the wander state.



### Behaviours
The snake has three steering behaviours and two states: avoidance behaviour, harmonic behaviour, seek behaviour, wander state, and attack state. The state machine will initialise the wander state at game start, which adopts the avoidance, harmonic, and seek behaviours all at once. The avoidance detects and avoids obstacles, the harmonic allows the snake to move in a slithering style of movement, and the seek behaviour and go to a destination point. Once the snake detects a mouse in its vicinity, it will change its state to the attack state.  
The attack state adopts all the behaviours as well up until it closly reaches the mouse, which will quickly lunge at the mouse with a chance of missing depending on its own orientation.

## Post Processing

We enabled a post processing function that you can toggle for a different experince when obeserving the simulation.
Pressing P you can switch camera states of visibility

The shader is implemented as a spatial shader with an unshaded render mode, allowing for efficient processing of each fragment. It utilizes uniform variables for edge threshold, saturation strength, and contrast strength, enabling dynamic adjustments to the visual effect.

It has a technique for edge detection by sampling depth and normal textures. By calculating differences in depth and normal values in both horizontal and vertical directions
Color processing begins with the conversion of color values to a linear color space to ensure accurate adjustments. Saturation is enhanced by preserving luminance while intensifying color values, and contrast is increased by manipulating color values around a midpoint.

```

void fragment() {
    vec4 color = texture(screen_texture, SCREEN_UV);
    
    // Sample depth and normal textures
    float depth = texture(depth_texture, SCREEN_UV).r;
    vec3 normal = texture(normal_texture, SCREEN_UV).rgb;

    // Calculate edge strength
    float depth_diff_x = abs(depth - texture(depth_texture, SCREEN_UV + vec2(0.001, 0)).r);
    float depth_diff_y = abs(depth - texture(depth_texture, SCREEN_UV + vec2(0, 0.001)).r);
    float depth_edge = smoothstep(0.0, edge_threshold, depth_diff_x + depth_diff_y);

    vec3 normal_diff_x = abs(normal - texture(normal_texture, SCREEN_UV + vec2(0.001, 0)).rgb);
    vec3 normal_diff_y = abs(normal - texture(normal_texture, SCREEN_UV + vec2(0, 0.001)).rgb);
    float normal_edge = smoothstep(0.0, edge_threshold, length(normal_diff_x + normal_diff_y));

    // Combine edge strengths
    float edge = max(depth_edge, normal_edge);
    
    // Convert to linear color space
    vec3 linear_color = color.rgb / max(color.a, 0.0001);  // Avoid division by zero
    
    // Apply saturation
    vec3 gray = vec3(dot(vec3(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722), linear_color));
    vec3 saturated_color = mix(gray, linear_color, saturation_strength);
    
    // Apply contrast
    vec3 contrasted_color = (saturated_color - 0.55) * contrast_strength + 0.5;
    
    // Mix original color with edge-enhanced color based on edge strength
    vec3 final_color = mix(contrasted_color, linear_color, edge);
    
    // Output the final color
    ALBEDO = vec3(final_color);
}
```

Having the vertex ensure the whole screen is encompassed

```
void vertex() {
    POSITION = vec4(VERTEX, 1.0);
}
```

## Particles

Particles were implemented for both the snakes movements and the blood splatter of the mouse once it was eaten, creating an ont-shot splashing effect.
Firefly parts were set up with a slight transparency for the environment, so with the day and night cycles bringing night to give the terrian a better nighttime atmosphere of glowling sparks of green

[David add a little some of the code you added for particals of the snake and mouse]

## Prior Snake Research

Having a close friend who supplies pet stores and zoos with a variety of different animals, we were able to learn firsthand how to handle the snakes.
We modelled the snake according to what we saw, and the textures matched the skin tone.Â 
We found that the snakes initially eat mice, so we added a mouse as its food source within the simulation.
It was a very interesting experience to be able to bring what we saw in the real world into a virtual world.
