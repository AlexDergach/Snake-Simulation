# Description of the project

A simulation of a snake traversing a forest and stone-like environment, avoiding obstacles and the water.
It has snake-like movements, and it wanders until it spots a mouse and will lunge at the mouse and eat it.
You are able to change the parameters of the snake with specific sliders.
There is altitude noise if the camera goes too high, and the closer you get to the snake you can hear it.

# Instructions for use

Run on Godot 4.2.2.stable.mono (The .NET version). Press F5 to run root scene

## In-Game Controls

- All controls will also be viewable in the UI

Base controls for the camera :
> [W A S D]

> [Shift] For speed and Camera FOV change

> [Control] For Camera to decrease elevation

> [Esc] To leave the simulation

> [Space] If Flying : Elevation if flying. If Not Flying: Jump on ground and double press for flight

> [V] Visability of the UI

> [F] Fullscreen toggle

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

- We are proud of snake item 1
- We are proud of snake item 2
- We are proud of the custom sound design and atmosphere
- We are proud of the partical designs
- We are proud of the dynamically changing UI
- We are proud of the mouse item 1
- We are proud of how the camera works
- We are proud we could mimic a cool lookin snake :D

# What I learned

- We learnt how snake item 1
- We learnt how snake item 2
- We learnt how snake item 3
- We learnt how mouse item 1
- We learnt about path finding and navigation
- We learnt about godot's lighting and shadow system for maps
- We learnt how challenging it can be to combine models and interact game systems and design
- We learnt how you can edit sound pitch and other effects

## Prior Snake Research

Having a close friend who supplies pet stores and zoos with a variety of different animals, we were able to learn firsthand how to handle the snakes.
We modelled the snake according to what we saw, and the textures matched the skin tone.Â 
We found that the snakes initially eat mice, so we added a mouse as its food source within the simulation.
It was a very interesting experience to be able to bring what we saw in the real world into a virtual world.
