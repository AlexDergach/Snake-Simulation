# Description of the project

A simulation of a snake traversing a forest and stone-like environment, avoiding obstacles and the water.
It has snake-like movements, and it wanders until it spots a mouse and will lunge at the mouse and eat it.
You are able to change the parameters of the snake with specific sliders.
There is altitude noise if the camera goes too high, and the closer you get to the snake you can hear it.
